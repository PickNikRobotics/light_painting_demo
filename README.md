# UR5 Light Painting Demo

### Adding a new image

Save a 1000-pixel by 1000-pixel image to /resources for future reference. The waypoints you want should be in the middle-ish.

You can easily edit the image and get X/Y coordinates at this website:  https://jspaint.app

Save the key point X/Y coordinates from the image to /resources/whatever_name.yaml. The upper left corner of the image is (0, 0)
